During my third semester at university, we were challenged to create an engine capable of playing a popular board or card game. This as of itself sounds relatively simple, however, the catch was that we had to go completely old school for this one. The game engine had to be written completely in x86 assembly.

Me, being the competitive and overly optimistic person that I am, decided that my game engine was going to be for chess. This proved to be very challenging for a sophomore and many late nights ensured. However, in the end, I managed to pull it off and thanks to this little project I got fairly comfortable with writing code in pure assembly.

I also made a simple GUI in C, using GTK. The following gif shows the NegaMax based AI in action!

PS: This is a fairly old project, however it's one I still felt worth making an entry for.
