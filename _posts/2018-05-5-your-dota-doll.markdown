If you play Dota 2, or any team based competitive games really, then you probably have a group of friends who you enjoy playing the occasional match with. Some of your friends may be better than others at the game but you still play with them anyways because it's just more fun that way.

Within my circle of Dota 2 buddies there is an ongoing joke that each person has someone who they seem to loose more with - aka their "Dota Doll".

I was messing around with the [Open Dota API](https://docs.opendota.com/) and quickly realized that it was possible to create a seemingly dynamic site that is fully static and freely hosted on sites such as [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Your Dota Doll](http://sethstalley.com/your-dota-doll/) is evidence of what can be done from a static website by using free API's and how you can even handle partial credential login (in the case of Steam Login) to obtain enough information about your user to offer a personalized "dynamic" experience.
