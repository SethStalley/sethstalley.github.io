<p>I have always been curious about how things work. Growing up, the internet and video games in particular caught my attention (big surprise). My fascination for the seemingly limitless potential of these virtual systems is what finally led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2014.</p>

Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer and Data Analyst at simMachines - a machine learning startup.

## Other Interests

* **AI**

    Artificial intelligence, being one of the hottest topics within my field, has definitely caught my interest. I by no means claim to be an expert in this area, however I am very interested expanding my knowledge and doing more work within this field.
    
* **Space**

    Inspired by what is going on in the private space sector, I hope to see humans land on Mars within the next decade.

* **Video Games**

    Video games in some ways best showcase the potential of virtual systems. Entire worlds not restrained by the laws of physics but by the imagination and rules of their creators. Blizzard in particular is one of my favorite such creators. Games such as StarCraft were a huge part of my high school years.
