<p>I have always been curious about how things work. Growing up, the internet and video games in particular caught my attention (big surprise). My fascination for the seemingly limitless potential of these virtual systems is what finally led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2014.</p>

<p>I have worked with the Unity game engine, done image and video processing with OpenCV, built mobile apps using frameworks such as ReactNative and built cloud infrastructures using AWS.
The speed and flexibility with which I can learn and adapt to new technologies and practices is what I consider to be my greatest strength.</p>

## Other Interests

* **Space**   
Inspired by what is going on in the private space sector. I hope to see humans land on Mars within the next decade.

* **Video Games**   
Video games in some ways best showcase the potential of virtual systems. Entire worlds not restrained by the laws of physics but by the imagination and rules of their creators. Blizzard in particular is my favorite such creator, games such as StarCraft were a huge part of my HS years and presently I am an avid player of World of Warcraft, Diablo and Hearthstone.

* **AI**   
Artificial intelligence, being one of the hottest topics within my field, it has definitely caught my interest. The life changing potential is ridiculous, albeit also a bit scary. I by no means claim to be an expert in this area, however I am very interested in expanding my knowledge on this topic.
