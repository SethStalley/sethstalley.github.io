<p>I've always been curious about how things work. Tearing things apart and attempting to rebuild them made me into a bit of a menace in my younger years. The internet and video games in particular caught my attention (big surprise). My fascination for the seemingly limitless potential of these virtual systems is what finally led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2014.</p>

<p>Currently I'm learning a bit of anything I can about everything. I have toyed with the Unity game engine, done image and video processing with OpenCV, built mobile apps using frameworks such as ReactNative and I have created cloud infrastructures with AWS.
The speed and flexibility with which I can learn and adapt to new technologies and practices is what I consider to be my greatest strength.</p>

## Other Interests

* **Space**   
Inspired by what is going on in the private space sector. I hope to see humans land on Mars within the next decade.

* **Video Games**   
Video games in some ways best showcase the potential of virtual systems. Entire worlds not restrained by the laws of physics but by the imagination and rules of their creators. Blizzard in particular is my favorite such creator, games such as StarCraft were a huge part of my HS years and presently I am an avid player of World of Warcraft and Hearthstone.

* **AI**   
Artificial intelligence, being one of the hottest topics within my field, it has definitely caught my interest. The potential appears to be revolutionary, albeit a bit scary. I by no means claim to be an expert in this area, however I am very interested expanding my knowledge when it comes to this topic.
